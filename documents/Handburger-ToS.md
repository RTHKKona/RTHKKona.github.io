# **Handburger Commission Terms of Service (ToS)**  
#### Effective Date: October 18, 2025  

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in commissioning me (“Handburger”).  
By commissioning my services through Ko-fi or any affiliated platform, you (“the Client”) agree to the following Terms of Service.  
Please read this document carefully before placing an order.

---

## **1. Overview**

These Terms of Service govern all commission-based work provided by Handburger, including music looping, editing, and related creative services.  
By submitting a commission request, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms in their entirety.

All prices are listed in **USD** unless otherwise specified.  
Communication, progress tracking, and file delivery are typically conducted via **Discord** and **Trello**.

---

## **2. Services & Pricing**

### **A. Base Commission Package**
* **Base Cost:** $8.50 for up to 3 (three) songs.  
* **Additional Songs:** $1.60 per extra song (beyond the first 3).  
* **Project Management Add-on:** $4.00 — Highly Recommended. Includes access to a dedicated private Trello board for the duration of your project. This board serves as the central hub for all communication, file delivery, and revisions until the project is marked complete. Also includes two (2) complimentary revisions.

### **B. Additional Work & Revisions**
All work requested after the initial version (v1) has been delivered is considered additional work. To ensure every request is handled efficiently, a processing fee is applied to new tasks submitted after a project is complete and the Trello board (if applicable) has been archived.

* **New Request Processing Fee:** $5.00 per re-opening the project after final iteration was provided. It covers the administrative time required to process the request and re-engage with the project.

* **Edit Existing Song:** $2.50 per edit (for songs already in the project).  
* **Add Brand New Edits:** $3.00 per new song outside the original commisson project scope.  

All prices are **non-negotiable**.

## **3. Ordering Process**

1. **Inquiry:**  
   Submit a commission form via my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/handburger/commissions) detailing your request.  

2. **Quote & Agreement:**  
   You will receive a price quote based on your project details. Once you confirm, full payment is required before I begin work.  

3. **Project Setup:**  
   After payment, I will produce the initial version (**v1**) of your commission.  
   If the Trello add-on was purchased, you’ll be invited to a private board for progress tracking and feedback.  

4. **Revisions:**  
   The Trello add-on includes 2 revisions (**v2** and **v3**) for refinement based on your feedback.  
   The first version (**v1**) is not counted as a revision.  

5. **Delivery:**  
   Final files are delivered digitally via a download link, typically through **Discord**.  
   Standard turnaround time is **4–5 days**, though this may vary depending on project complexity, private matters, and communication speed.  
   Products are delivered **as-is** unless further revisions are purchased.

## **4. Revisions & Communication**

* Revisions must be requested within a **reasonable timeframe** after receiving the previous version.  
* Revisions are intended for **minor or moderate adjustments** (e.g. structural balance, timing tweaks), not complete remakes.  
* Requests made **after** the Trello project is finalized will incur the **New Request Processing Fee** plus any related costs.

> A reasonable timeframe is defined as within *1 month (31 Days)*.

### **Client Inactivity / Rejection Clause**
* If the Client becomes inactive or fails to respond for **31 days**, the project will be marked as complete and closed with no refunds or further revisions.  
* Repeated rejections or full project restarts may be declined or charged additional fees.

---

## **5. Payment Terms**

* All payments must be made **in full upfront** before any work begins.  
* Payments are securely processed through **Ko-fi**.  
* Prices are fixed and **non-negotiable**.  
* Work will not start until payment is confirmed.

---

## **6. Cancellations & Refunds**

* If the Client cancels **before work begins**, a **full refund** will be issued.  
* If the Client cancels **after work has begun** (i.e. after version v1 is delivered), **no refund** will be issued.  
* Refunds are not available for completed projects or missed communication leading to project closure.  

These policies exist to respect the creative time, effort, and scheduling involved in each project.

---

## **7. Ownership & Usage Rights**

* Upon full payment and delivery, the Client obtains the right to use the final commissioned work for **personal or commercial projects**.  
* Handburger retains **creator rights** to display, promote, or showcase the commissioned work in portfolios, social media posts, or examples of previous work.  
* The Client may request that their project remain **private**, in which case I will not display it publicly.

Unpaid or cancelled works remain the full property of Handburger and may not be used, reposted, or redistributed by the Client.

---

## **8. Privacy & Data Use**

* Personal information (e.g. name, email, Discord or Trello usernames) is collected **only** for commission-related communication, delivery, and organization.  
* I will never share, sell, or distribute personal data to third parties.  
* Any stored project information may be deleted upon request once the project is completed.

---

## **9. Miscellaneous**

* Communication should be respectful, timely, and clear to ensure smooth collaboration.  
* Estimated timelines are **approximations**, not guarantees.  
* These terms may be updated periodically, and any significant changes will be reflected on my Ko-fi or GitHub page.  
* Continued communication or payment after an update constitutes acceptance of the new version.
