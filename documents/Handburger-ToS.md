# **Commission Terms & Conditions**

#### Dated - October 18th, 2025

By commissioning me, you ("the Client") agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before initiating a commission.

## **1. Services & Pricing**

All prices are in USD.

### **A. Initial Commission Package**
*   **Base Cost:** $8.50 for up to 3 (three) songs.
*   **Additional Songs:** $1.60 per song (beyond the initial 3).
*   **Project Management Add-on:** $4.00 for access to a private Trello board and 2 revisions.

### **B. Post-Trello Adjustments & Additional Work**
Once the Trello board is set up and the initial revision period has begun, any new requests or significant changes will be subject to the following fees. This is to cover the administrative and creative work of altering an existing project plan.
*   **Post-Trello Change Fee:** A one-time fee of $5.00 is applied for any new requests made after the initial commission is locked in the Trello board.
*   **Additional Song Edits:** $2.50 per edit (for songs already part of the commission).
*   **Brand New Edits:** $3.00 per new song or edit not included in the original scope.
*   **Additional Revisions:** $4.00 per revision after the initial 2 revisions included in the add-on have been used.

## **2. The Commission Process**

1.  **Inquiry:** The Client fills out the commission form on my Ko-fi page with details of their request.
2.  **Quote & Agreement:** I will provide a final quote based on your request. Full payment is required upfront before work begins.
3.  **Project Setup:** Once payment is confirmed, I will create the initial version (v1) of your commission. If you purchased the Trello add-on, you will receive an invitation to a private board to track progress.
4.  **Revisions:** The Client may provide feedback for revisions. The initial production (v1) is not counted as a revision. The "Trello + 2 Revisions" add-on covers the creation of v2 and v3 based on your feedback.
5.  **Final Delivery:** Upon approval of the final version, I will deliver the completed files as specified.

## **3. Revisions Policy**

*   Revisions must be requested within a reasonable timeframe.
*   Revisions are for minor to moderate adjustments (e.g. small structural tweaks). They are not for creating a brand new piece.
*   If you require more than the number of revisions you purchased, additional revisions can be purchased for $4.00 each.
*   Any new requests added *after* the project has been started on Trello will incur the "Post-Trello Change Fee" plus any applicable costs for the new work.

## **4. Payment Terms**

*   Full payment is required before I begin any work on the commission.
*   Payments are processed securely through Ko-fi.
*   All prices are non-negotiable.

## **5. Cancellation & Refund Policy**

*   If a commission is cancelled by the Client **before** work has commenced, a full refund will be issued.
*   If a commission is cancelled by the Client **after** work has begun (i.e., after the initial v1 has been delivered), no refund will be issued as the time and creative effort have already been spent.

## **6. Copyright & Usage**

*   Upon final payment and delivery, the Client retains the rights to use the final commissioned audio for their personal or commercial projects.
*   I, the artist ("Handburger"), retain the right to display the commissioned work in my portfolio and on social media to showcase my skills, unless the Client explicitly requests it to be kept private.

## **7. Agreement**

By sending payment for a commission, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and Conditions.
